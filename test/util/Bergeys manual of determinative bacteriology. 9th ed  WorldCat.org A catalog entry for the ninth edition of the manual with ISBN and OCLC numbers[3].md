# Bergey's Manual of Determinative Bacteriology 9th Edition: A Comprehensive Guide for Microbiologists
 
Bergey's Manual of Determinative Bacteriology is a classic reference book for identifying and classifying bacteria. It was first published in 1923 by David Hendricks Bergey, who was the chief bacteriologist at the Pennsylvania Department of Health. Since then, it has undergone several revisions and updates, with the latest being the 9th edition, published in 1994.
 
The 9th edition of Bergey's Manual of Determinative Bacteriology (BMDB-9) is based on the data contained in the four-volume Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology (BMSB), which covers the taxonomy and phylogeny of bacteria. BMDB-9 provides concise and practical information for identifying bacteria by their morphological, physiological, biochemical, and ecological characteristics. It also includes new genera and species, new combinations, and new taxa published through the January 1992 issue of the International Journal of Systematic Bacteriology (IJSB).

BMDB-9 is divided into 18 groups, based on the Gram reaction, cell shape, oxygen requirement, metabolic type, habitat, and ecology of bacteria. Each group contains a general description of the organisms, followed by keys or tables to genera and species, genus descriptions, synonyms, other nomenclatural changes, and illustrations. BMDB-9 also contains chapters on using the manual, difficulties in identification, growth and examination of actinomycetes, oxygenic phototrophic bacteria, budding and appendaged bacteria, sheathed bacteria, single-celled rod-shaped gliding bacteria, gram-positive cocci, endospore-forming gram-positive rods, mycobacteria, streptomyces and related genera, cell wall-less archaeobacteria, extremely thermophilic and hyperthermophilic archaeobacteria.
 
BMDB-9 is an indispensable tool for microbiologists who need to identify and classify bacteria in various fields of research and application. It is also a valuable reference for students and teachers of microbiology who want to learn more about the diversity and evolution of bacteria. BMDB-9 can be purchased online from various sources[^1^] [^2^] or accessed through libraries[^3^].

BMDB-9 has received positive reviews from users who have found it useful and reliable for identifying bacteria. For example, one user wrote on Amazon.com[^1^]: "This book is a must have for anyone working with bacteria. It is easy to use and very comprehensive. It covers all the major groups of bacteria and gives detailed descriptions of each genus and species. It also has many illustrations and tables that help with identification. I use it almost every day in my microbiology lab and I highly recommend it."
 
Another user wrote on the same website[^1^]: "I bought this book for my microbiology class and I am very happy with it. It is very well organized and informative. It has helped me a lot with my lab reports and exams. It is also very interesting to read about the different types of bacteria and their characteristics. It is a great reference book for anyone interested in microbiology."
 
BMDB-9 is not without its limitations, however. Some users have pointed out that it does not include all the recent changes and additions in bacterial taxonomy and nomenclature, since it was published almost 30 years ago. Some users have also noted that it is expensive and heavy to carry around. Therefore, some users have suggested that an online or electronic version of BMDB-9 would be more convenient and updated.
 
Nevertheless, BMDB-9 remains a classic and authoritative source of information on bacterial identification and classification. It is widely used and respected by microbiologists around the world. It is also a testament to the legacy of David Hendricks Bergey and his successors, who have contributed to the advancement of microbiology through their work on Bergey's Manual.
