## Food Hygiene and Sanitation Tips
 
Food hygiene and sanitation are not only the responsibility of food handlers, but also of consumers. Everyone who eats or prepares food should follow some basic tips to prevent foodborne illnesses and ensure food safety. Here are some of the most important food hygiene and sanitation tips that you should know:
 
- **Proper personal hygiene**. This includes washing your hands and arms with soap and water for at least 20 seconds before, during, and after handling food, especially raw meat, poultry, seafood, eggs, and flour. You should also wash your hands after using the bathroom, touching your face, hair, or nose, coughing or sneezing, handling garbage, or touching pets. You should also cover any cuts or wounds with a bandage and wear gloves when handling food. You should also avoid wearing jewelry, nail polish, or artificial nails when preparing food. You should also wear clean clothes and aprons and tie back your hair if it is long.
- **Proper cleaning and sanitizing**. This involves removing any dirt, grease, or food residues from food contact surfaces, equipment, utensils, and dishes with hot water and detergent. Then, you should apply a sanitizer that is approved for food use at the correct concentration and contact time. You should also rinse and air-dry the items after sanitizing. You should also clean and sanitize your sinks, drains, faucets, cutting boards, knives, thermometers, can openers, etc. regularly. You should also use separate cloths or paper towels for cleaning and sanitizing .
- **Proper storage and handling**. This involves keeping raw and cooked foods separate to prevent cross-contamination. You should also store raw meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs in sealed containers or packages on the bottom shelf of the refrigerator or freezer to prevent their juices from dripping onto other foods. You should also store cooked foods in shallow containers and refrigerate or freeze them within two hours of cooking. You should also label and date your foods and use them within their shelf life. You should also check the temperature of your refrigerator (40Â°F or below) and freezer (0Â°F or below) regularly.
- **Proper cooking and reheating**. This involves cooking foods to the right temperature to kill any harmful germs that may cause food poisoning. You should use a food thermometer to check the internal temperature of foods such as meat, poultry, seafood, eggs, casseroles, etc. You should also cook fish until it is opaque and flakes easily with a fork. You should also microwave foods thoroughly and let them stand for a few minutes before eating. When reheating foods, you should bring them to a temperature of 165Â°F or higher .
- **Proper cooling and thawing**. This involves cooling foods quickly to prevent the growth of bacteria that can spoil them or make you sick. You should divide large portions of food into smaller containers and refrigerate or freeze them as soon as possible. You should also avoid stacking containers too close together to allow air circulation. You should also thaw frozen foods safely by placing them in the refrigerator, under cold running water, or in the microwave. You should never thaw foods at room temperature or in hot water .

By following these food hygiene and sanitation tips, you can reduce the risk of foodborne illnesses and ensure food safety for yourself and others.
