Reverb is the sound of reflections from walls, floors, ceilings and other surfaces in a room. It can add depth and realism to your recordings, but it can also make them sound muddy, distant and unclear. If you want to reduce the amount of reverb in your recordings, you can use a plugin like Acon Digital DeVerberate 2.0.2.

Acon Digital DeVerberate 2.0.2 is a plugin that can attenuate or boost the reverberation that is already present in recorded material. It works by splitting the incoming audio into an estimation of the direct sound and the reverberated sound, which can then be recombined freely. You can adjust the balance between the direct and reverberated sound, as well as the decay time and frequency characteristics of the reverb.
 
Acon Digital DeVerberate 2.0.2 also includes a unique Early Reflections Filter that can cancel out the effect of the early reflections, which are the first echoes that arrive at the microphone after bouncing off nearby surfaces. These early reflections can make the sound source appear closer or farther away than it actually is, and can also affect the timbre and clarity of the sound.

To use Acon Digital DeVerberate 2.0.2, you need to insert it as a plugin on the track or bus that contains the audio you want to process. You can then use the Input Analyzer to see the level and frequency spectrum of the input signal, and use the Output Analyzer to see how the plugin affects the output signal. You can also use the Bypass button to compare the processed and unprocessed sound.
 
The main controls of Acon Digital DeVerberate 2.0.2 are located in the center of the plugin window. You can use the Reverb Time knob to adjust how long the reverb lasts, and use the Reverb Level knob to adjust how loud the reverb is relative to the direct sound. You can also use the Dry/Wet knob to adjust how much of the original signal is mixed with the processed signal.
 
The Early Reflections Filter is located on the left side of the plugin window. You can use the Enable button to turn it on or off, and use the Learn button to let the plugin automatically estimate the impulse response of the early reflections based on your input signal. You can also use the Early Reflections Level knob to adjust how much of the early reflections are removed or added.
 
The Advanced Settings are located on the right side of the plugin window. You can use them to fine-tune how the plugin works internally. You can adjust the FFT Size, which determines how many frequency bands are used for processing, and use the Oversampling option to reduce aliasing artifacts. You can also adjust the Frequency Smoothing, which determines how smooth or sharp the frequency response of the reverb is, and use the High Frequency Damping option to reduce high frequency reverb more than low frequency reverb.
 
Acon Digital DeVerberate 2.0.2 is a powerful and versatile plugin that can help you improve your recordings by reducing unwanted reverb. You can download a free trial version from [https://acondigital.com/products/deverberate/](https://acondigital.com/products/deverberate/) and try it for yourself.
