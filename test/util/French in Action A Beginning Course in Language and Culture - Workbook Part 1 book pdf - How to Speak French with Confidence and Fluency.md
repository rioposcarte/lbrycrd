French in Action is a popular and innovative course for learning French that combines video-based instruction with a textbook and a workbook. The course was created by Pierre Capretz, a professor of French at Yale University, and has been widely used in colleges, universities, and high schools since its first edition in 1987. The third edition of the workbook, part 1, was published in 2012 and covers the first 26 lessons of the course.
 
The workbook is designed to complement the textbook and the video series, which are available online or on DVD. The workbook provides exercises and activities that reinforce the grammar, vocabulary, and culture presented in the textbook and the video. The workbook also includes a journal by Marie-Laure, a fictional character who comments on the changes in the world since the first edition of the course. The workbook is written in both English and French, and has an answer key at the end.
