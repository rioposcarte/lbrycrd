- A USB drive formatted as FAT32.
- A PC with Windows and .NET Framework 4.0 or higher.
- The PSN Package NPDRM tool, which you can download from [here\[^1^\]](https://www.psx-place.com/threads/psn_package_npdrm.22895/).
- The content that you want to package, such as homebrew, emulators, games, themes, etc.

## Steps

1. Extract the PSN Package NPDRM tool to a folder on your PC.
2. Create a folder named "package" inside the PSN Package NPDRM folder.
3. Copy the content that you want to package into the "package" folder. For example, if you want to package a PS1 emulator, copy the emulator files and folders into the "package" folder.
4. Run the psn\_package\_npdrm.exe file as administrator.
5. Fill in the required fields in the tool. You can use the following values as a reference:
    - Title ID: A unique identifier for your package. It must start with "NP" and be 9 characters long. For example, "NPXX00001".
    - Title: The name of your package. For example, "PS1 Emulator".
    - Content ID: A unique identifier for your content. It must start with "UP" and be 36 characters long. For example, "UP0000-NPXX00001\_00-0000000000000000".
    - Version: The version number of your package. For example, "01.00".
    - Type: The type of your package. You can choose from "Game", "Theme", "Homebrew", or "Other".
    - Forced Install To: The location where your package will be installed on your PS3. You can choose from "HDD0", "USB0", or "None". If you choose "None", the user will be able to choose the location when installing the package.
6. Click on "Create PKG" and wait for the process to finish. You will see a message saying "PKG created successfully" when it is done.
7. Copy the generated PKG file from the PSN Package NPDRM folder to the root of your USB drive.
8. Eject your USB drive from your PC and connect it to your PS3.
9. On your PS3, go to "Package Manager" and select "Install Package Files".
10. Select your USB drive and choose the PKG file that you created.
11. Wait for the installation to complete and enjoy your custom package.

## Tips

- You can use the make\_package\_license tool to create license files for your packages. This tool is a compiled version of the make\_pkg script developed by CaptainCPS-X. You can download it from [here\[^1^\]](https://www.psx-place.com/threads/psn_package_npdrm.22895/).
