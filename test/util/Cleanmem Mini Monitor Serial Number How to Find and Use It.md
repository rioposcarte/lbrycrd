## How CleanMem Works
 
CleanMem works by calling a Windows API function called EmptyWorkingSet. This function trims the working set of all processes and moves the trimmed memory to the page file. The working set is the amount of physical memory that a process is using. By trimming the working set, CleanMem frees up some physical memory and reduces the need for swapping memory pages to and from the disk.
 
CleanMem does not change the priority or the memory allocation of processes. It simply asks Windows to do the trimming and moving. This way, CleanMem does not interfere with the Windows memory manager or cause any crashes or performance hits. CleanMem is compatible with all versions of Windows from 2000 to 10, both 32-bit and 64-bit.
 
CleanMem runs every 15 minutes by default, but you can change the interval in the CleanMem settings program. You can also create ignore lists or only lists to exclude or include certain processes from being trimmed. You can also enable logging to see how much memory is trimmed each time CleanMem runs.
