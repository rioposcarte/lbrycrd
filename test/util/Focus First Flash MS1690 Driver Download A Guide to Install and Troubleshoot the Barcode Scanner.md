In this article, we will show you how to download and install the Focus First Flash MS1690 driver for Windows 10. We will also provide some troubleshooting tips in case you encounter any problems.
 
## Step 1: Download the Driver
 
The first step is to download the driver from the official website of Honeywell, the manufacturer of the scanner. You can use this link[^1^] to access the download page. You will need to enter your product model number (MS1690) and select your operating system (Windows 10) from the drop-down menus. Then, click on the "Search" button.
 
You will see a list of available drivers for your scanner. Depending on your USB interface, you may need to choose between USB LS (low speed) or USB FS (full speed). You can check your USB interface by looking at the label on the bottom of your scanner. It should have a code like USB-38 or USB-106.
 
For example, if you have a USB LS interface, you should download the driver named "HSM USB Serial Driver r1.12.zip". If you have a USB FS interface, you should download the driver named "HSM USB COM Port Driver r1.12.zip". Click on the "Download" button next to the driver name and save the file to your computer.
 
## Step 2: Install the Driver
 
The next step is to install the driver on your computer. To do this, you need to unzip the file that you downloaded in the previous step. You can use any software that can extract ZIP files, such as WinZip or 7-Zip. After extracting the file, you will see a folder with several files inside.
 
Open the folder and double-click on the file named "setup.exe". This will launch the installation wizard that will guide you through the process. Follow the instructions on the screen and accept the license agreement. When prompted, choose a destination folder for the driver files and click on "Install". The installation may take a few minutes to complete.
 
When the installation is finished, click on "Finish" and restart your computer. This will ensure that the driver is properly loaded and ready to use.
