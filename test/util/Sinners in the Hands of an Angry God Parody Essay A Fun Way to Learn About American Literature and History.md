# Saints in the Hands of a Loving God: A Parody of Jonathan Edwards's Famous Sermon
 
My dear friends, I come to you today with a message of hope and joy. You are not sinners in the hands of an angry God, but saints in the hands of a loving God. You are not doomed to eternal torment, but destined for eternal bliss. You are not objects of wrath, but objects of grace. You are not hated by God, but loved by God.
 
How do I know this? Because God has revealed it to us in his Word and in his Son. God has shown us his love by sending his only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, to die for our sins and to rise again for our justification. God has shown us his love by giving us his Holy Spirit, who dwells in us and guides us into all truth. God has shown us his love by calling us his children and heirs of his kingdom.

But you may ask, what about the passages in the Bible that speak of God's wrath and judgment? What about the passages that describe hell as a place of fire and brimstone? What about the passages that warn us of the narrow gate and the broad way? Are they not true?

They are true, but they are not literal. They are figurative expressions of God's justice and mercy. They are meant to awaken us to our need for repentance and faith. They are meant to show us the seriousness of sin and the greatness of salvation. They are meant to lead us to Christ, who is the way, the truth, and the life.
 
God is not angry with you, my friends. He is angry with sin, which separates you from him. He is angry with the devil, who deceives you and accuses you. He is angry with the world, which corrupts you and oppresses you. But he is not angry with you. He loves you with an everlasting love. He desires you with a holy passion. He pursues you with a relentless grace.
 
And he will not let you go. He will not cast you into hell. He will not abandon you to your fate. He will not give up on you. He will save you. He will sanctify you. He will glorify you.
 
For he is a loving God, a faithful God, a gracious God. He is a God who keeps his promises, who fulfills his covenants, who accomplishes his purposes. He is a God who is sovereign over all things, who works all things for good, who makes all things new.
 
He is your God, and you are his people. He is your Father, and you are his children. He is your Savior, and you are his saints.
 
So rejoice, my friends. Rejoice in the Lord always. Again I say, rejoice. For you are saints in the hands of a loving God.

But how can we rejoice in the Lord always? How can we experience his love in our daily lives? How can we overcome the doubts and fears that may plague us?
 
The answer is simple: by faith. By faith we believe that God loves us and has forgiven us through Christ. By faith we receive his grace and mercy every day. By faith we trust his promises and follow his commands. By faith we abide in him and he abides in us.
 
By faith we also love one another as he has loved us. We show his love by our words and deeds. We serve one another with humility and kindness. We forgive one another as he has forgiven us. We bear one another's burdens and share one another's joys.
 
By faith we also love our enemies and pray for those who persecute us. We show his love by our patience and gentleness. We bless those who curse us and do good to those who hate us. We overcome evil with good and seek peace with all people.
 
By faith we also love ourselves as he has loved us. We show his love by our gratitude and contentment. We accept ourselves as his beloved creations and stewards. We care for our bodies and souls as his temples and gifts. We grow in his likeness and glory.
 
By faith we also love his creation as he has loved us. We show his love by our stewardship and responsibility. We appreciate the beauty and diversity of his works. We use the resources he has given us wisely and generously. We protect the environment he has entrusted to us.
 
By faith we also love his church as he has loved us. We show his love by our fellowship and unity. We worship him together in spirit and truth. We edify one another with our gifts and talents. We participate in his mission and ministry.
