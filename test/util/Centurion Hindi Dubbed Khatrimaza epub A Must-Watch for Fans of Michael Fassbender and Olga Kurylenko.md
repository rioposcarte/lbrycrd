Centurion is a 2010 British historical action-war film written and directed by Neil Marshall, loosely based on the disappearance of the Roman Empire's Ninth Legion in Caledonia in the early second century AD. The film stars Michael Fassbender, Dominic West and Olga Kurylenko.
 
The film follows Quintus Dias (Fassbender), a Roman centurion who survives a Pictish raid and joins the remnants of the Ninth Legion under General Virilus (West) in their mission to wipe out the Picts and their leader Gorlacon (Ulrich Thomsen). However, the legion is ambushed and massacred by the Picts, leaving Quintus and a few survivors as fugitives behind enemy lines. They are pursued by a relentless tracker named Etain (Kurylenko), a Pict warrior who has a personal vendetta against the Romans.

Centurion is a film that explores the themes of survival, loyalty, honor and revenge. It depicts the brutal and savage nature of war and the clash of cultures between the Romans and the Picts. The film also shows the human side of the characters, their motivations and emotions, and their struggles to overcome their fears and doubts.
 
The film received mixed reviews from critics and audiences. Some praised the film for its realistic and gritty portrayal of the Roman-Pictish war, its action sequences, its cinematography and its performances. Others criticized the film for its lack of historical accuracy, its thin plot, its stereotypical characters and its excessive violence and gore. The film was also a box office flop, grossing only $6.8 million against a budget of $12 million.
 
Centurion is a film that may appeal to fans of historical action movies who enjoy watching battles, sword fights and chase scenes. However, it may not be suitable for viewers who are looking for a more nuanced and complex story, who are sensitive to graphic violence and bloodshed, or who are interested in learning more about the history and culture of the Romans and the Picts.

Centurion is a film that was inspired by the legend of the lost Ninth Legion, a Roman legion that supposedly vanished in Britain in the second century AD. The film offers one possible explanation for what happened to the legion, but it is not based on historical facts. The film takes many liberties and creative license with the events and characters of the Roman-Pictish war, and it does not reflect the actual historical record.

The film also features several historical inaccuracies and anachronisms, such as the use of modern English language and accents, the depiction of the Picts as barbaric savages, the portrayal of Etain as a mute scout, the presence of female warriors among the Picts, and the inclusion of a Roman soldier from Africa. The film also ignores the political and social context of the Roman-Pictish war, and focuses more on the personal conflicts and motivations of the main characters.
 
Centurion is a film that should be viewed as a fictional and entertaining story, rather than a historical and educational one. It is not meant to be a faithful representation of the Roman-Pictish war, but rather a creative and imaginative interpretation of it. The film does not claim to be historically accurate, and it does not intend to offend or misinform anyone. It is simply a film that aims to entertain and thrill its viewers with its action and drama.
