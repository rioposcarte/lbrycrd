In this article, we will take a closer look at some of the features and benefits of Tone2 Icarus 1.6, and show you how to use it to create amazing sounds.
 
## 3D Wavetable Synthesis
 
One of the main attractions of Tone2 Icarus 1.6 is its 3D wavetable synthesis technology. This is a novel approach that extends the traditional wavetable synthesis by adding an additional dimension for morphing. This means that you can not only change the position of the waveform along the time axis, but also along the frequency axis. This allows you to create complex and dynamic sounds that evolve over time and frequency.
 
To use the 3D wavetable synthesis, you need to load a wavetable into one of the three oscillators. You can choose from over 3000 wavetables that are included in Tone2 Icarus 1.6, or import your own. You can then use the Morph knob to change the position of the waveform along the time axis, and the Warp knob to change it along the frequency axis. You can also modulate these parameters with various sources, such as envelopes, LFOs, or MIDI controllers.
 
Another way to use the 3D wavetable synthesis is to load two different wavetables into two oscillators, and then use the Mix knob to cross-mix them in an additional dimension. This creates a new hybrid wavetable that combines the characteristics of both wavetables. You can also modulate the Mix parameter with various sources, creating even more variations.
 
## Resynthesis Engine
 
Another innovative feature of Tone2 Icarus 1.6 is its resynthesis engine. This is a powerful tool that can analyze any sound and rebuild it as a new wavetable. You can import any audio file, such as a sample, a loop, a vocal, or even an image, and Tone2 Icarus 1.6 will convert it into a wavetable that you can use in your synthesis.
 
To use the resynthesis engine, you need to click on the Import button in the oscillator section, and select an audio file or an image from your computer. You can then choose from various analysis and synthesis methods, such as FFT, Additive, Formant, Granular, or Image. Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages, depending on the type and quality of the input sound. You can also adjust various parameters, such as pitch detection, noise reduction, or harmonic enhancement.
 
Once you have imported your sound as a wavetable, you can edit it with the waveform editor. This is a graphical editor that lets you draw, erase, smooth, or modify the harmonics of the waveform. You can also apply various effects, such as distortion, filter, phase shift, or bitcrush. You can also copy and paste parts of the waveform, or reverse it.
 
## Factory Sounds
 
Tone2 Icarus 1.6 also comes with a huge amount of inspiring factory sounds that you can use in your music production. You can choose from over 1600 presets that cover a wide range of genres and styles, from EDM to cinematic to ambient. You can also browse the sounds by category, rating, or mood.
 
The factory sounds are designed by professional sound designers and artists who have used Tone2 Icarus 1.6 to its full potential. They showcase the versatility and quality of Tone2 Icarus 1.6's synthesis engine and effects section. You can use them as they are, or tweak them to suit your needs.
 
You can also use the smart randomizer to generate new variations of the factory sounds. The randomizer will change some parameters of the sound while keeping its overall character and quality. You can also lock some parameters that you don't want to change.
