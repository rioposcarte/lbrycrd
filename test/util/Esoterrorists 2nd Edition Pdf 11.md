The Esoterrorists 2nd Edition is a game that rewards curiosity, courage, and cunning. It is a game that challenges the players to uncover the truth behind the mysteries and to stop the Esoterrorists from destroying the world. It is a game that offers a thrilling and satisfying experience for both the GM and the players. If you are looking for a game that combines investigation, horror, and action, you should definitely check out The Esoterrorists 2nd Edition.
  
One of the distinctive features of The Esoterrorists 2nd Edition is the concept of the Membrane, which is the barrier that separates our reality from the Outer Dark, a realm of chaos and horror. The Esoterrorists are trying to weaken and rupture the Membrane by creating and spreading lies, myths, and conspiracies that erode the collective belief in rationality and order. The Ordo Veritatis agents are tasked with preventing and repairing the damage done by the Esoterrorists, by exposing and eliminating their agents and operations, and by restoring the public trust in reality.
 
The game also introduces a new mechanic called the Ordo Veritatis Rules of Engagement, which are a set of guidelines that regulate the actions and behaviors of the agents in the field. The rules are designed to protect the agents from legal and ethical repercussions, as well as to preserve the secrecy and integrity of the Ordo Veritatis. However, the rules also impose certain limitations and restrictions on the agents, such as avoiding collateral damage, respecting human rights, and reporting any anomalies or breaches. The GM can use the rules as a source of tension and drama, by presenting situations where the agents have to choose between following the rules or breaking them for a greater good.
 
The Esoterrorists 2nd Edition is a game that explores themes such as truth, reality, morality, and responsibility. It is a game that asks questions such as: What is real? What is right? What is worth fighting for? It is a game that invites the players to create their own answers and to shape their own stories. It is a game that delivers a compelling and immersive experience for anyone who enjoys investigative roleplaying games.
