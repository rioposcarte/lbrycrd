# LogiTRACE: A Great Tool for Engineering and Sheet Metal Work
 
LogiTRACE is a software that allows you to design and unfold complex shapes for sheet metal work. It is especially useful for engineering, piping ventilation and general sheet metal work. You can create your own shapes or use predefined ones, and then export them to DXF or IGES files for further processing. LogiTRACE also supports various cutting machines and nesting software.

LogiTRACE is not only a software for designing and unfolding shapes, but also a software for calculating and optimizing material usage. You can enter the dimensions and thickness of the sheet metal you want to use, and LogiTRACE will calculate the best way to cut and nest the shapes to minimize waste. You can also adjust the cutting parameters, such as kerf width, lead-in and lead-out, to improve the quality and speed of the cutting process.
 
Another feature of LogiTRACE is that it allows you to simulate the bending process of the sheet metal. You can see how the shape will look like after being bent, and check for any errors or collisions. You can also modify the bending parameters, such as bend radius, bend angle and bend allowance, to achieve the desired result. LogiTRACE can also generate reports and labels for each part, which can help you with the assembly and documentation of your project.
